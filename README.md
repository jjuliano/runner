# Runner
A simple graph-based orchestrated runner

## Step 1: Create your workflow
`myService/runner.yml`

```yaml
workflows:
  - resources/github.yaml
  - resources/auth.yaml
  - resources/database.yaml
  - resources/backend.yaml
  - resources/redis.yaml
  - resources/kafka.yaml
  - resources/docker.yaml
  - https://example.com/runner.yaml
```

## Step 2: Create your resources
`myService/resources/backend1.yaml`

```yaml
resources:
  - id: backend1
    name: "Backend1 is responsible for setting up Auth"
    desc: "Backend1 handles authentication between API calls"
    category: "auth"
    requires:
      - github-accesss
      - helm-charts
      - helm-postgresql
    run:
      - name: "Clone repo"
        check:
          - "FILE:data/files.txt"
          - "ENV:GH_TOKEN"
          - "CMD:git"
        exec: |
            git clone https://github.com/example/backend1.git backend1
      - name: "Compile project"
        check:
          - "ENV:SOME_TOKEN"
          - "ENV:RUNNER_PARAMS1"
          - "CMD:make"
          - "CMD:go"
        exec: "make build"
```

## Step 3: Run

`$ runner run backend1`

## Step 4: (Optional) See direct or reverse dependencies

`$ runner rdepends git`

```text
git
git -> jdberry-tag
git -> jdberry-tag -> ai-tag
git -> jdberry-tag -> ai-tag -> ai-organize-file
```

## Usage

### Preflight/Postflight Checks and Skipping Steps

You can define rules to check conditions before and after executing a command. You can also specify conditions to skip a step.

* Preflight checks are defined in the `check:` array.
* Postflight checks are defined in the `expect:` array.
* Skip conditions are set using the `skip:` array.

You can negate any check by prefixing it with `!`.

```yaml
  check:
    - "ENV:SHOULD_EXISTS"
    - "!ENV:SHOULD_NOT_EXISTS"
  expect:
    - "CMD:command_should_exists_in_path"
  skip:
    - "FILE:/skip/if/this/file/exists.txt"
```

### Supported Prefixes

The following prefixes are available for condition checks:

* `ENV:`  - Check if an environment variable exists.
* `FILE:` - Check if a file exists.
* `DIR:`  - Check if a directory exists.
* `URL:`  - Check if a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) URL exists.
* `CMD:`  - Check if a command exists in the `$PATH`.
* `EXEC:` - Check if a command runs successfully (returns a 0 exit code).

### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables using the `env:` array. Values can be sourced from a `file:`, the result of an `exec:` command, a static `value:`, or by requesting user input with `input:`.

```yaml
  env:
    - name: "FILE_CONTENTS"
      file: "$RUNNER_PARAMS1"
    - name: "FILE_TYPE"
      exec: "file $KDEPS_PARAMS1"
    - name: "HELLO"
      value: "WORLD"
    - name: "GH_TOKEN"
      input: "Please enter the GH_TOKEN:"
```

Additionally, you can directly append variables to `$RUNNER_ENV`.

### Optional Parameters

Optional parameters can be passed using the `--params` flag. The syntax is `--params "Hello;World"`, which translates to `$RUNNER_PARAMS1` ("Hello") and `$RUNNER_PARAMS2` ("World") in the context of the resources.
